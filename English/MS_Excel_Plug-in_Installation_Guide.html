    <p>SugarCRM's Plug-in for Microsoft Excel enables you to create, delete, update, or view data that is in your SugarCRM application. You can view and/or edit data by either pulling in data from the built in Query Wizard or you can pull in data from reports that are built in Sugar. The plug-in is available with all commercial editions of Sugar and must be installed on each computer running Excel where the plug-in is desired.</p>
    <h2 id="f-4b14-5bbc-098d-5606f97b26ab_Steps_to_Complete">Steps to Complete</h2>
    <p>If you are installing the Excel plug-in for a user, you will need to be logged in as the user on their computer. The user also needs to have full administrator privileges to write to the necessary files and directories. Please note that attempting to install the Excel plug-in for a non-administrator user on the computer may not be successful. The steps below will go through how to access and install the zip file required to download and install Sugar Plug-in for Excel.</p>
    <h3 id="f-4b14-5bbc-098d-5606f97b26ab_Check_Microsoft_Excel_Version">Check Microsoft Excel Version</h3>
    <p>You must download and install the correct version of the Sugar Plug-in for Excel to match your software's version. In order to verify the installed version and bit version of Excel, check under "About Excel" or via File &gt; Help depending on the version of Excel that you have. Please note that a 64-bit computer may be running a 32-bit Excel application, so it is best to check prior to running the installation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/991a0262-12fe-1fc4-1802-55028b2166e9.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/991a0262-12fe-1fc4-1802-55028b2166e9.png" width="276" /></p>

        <h2 id="f-4b14-5bbc-098d-5606f97b26ab_Necessary_Libraries">Necessary Libraries</h2>
        <p>The Sugar Plug-in for Excel requires several libraries to function. The setup.exe file will install two of the necessary libraries if needed. Please note that running "SugarExcelx64.msi" only installs the Sugar Plug-in for Excel and may not result in a functioning plug-in if these other components have not been installed previously.</p>
        <p>The necessary libraries are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Microsoft Office 2010 Primary Interop Assemblies (included in setup.exe installer).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Tools for Office SE Runtime (included in setup.exe installer).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Microsoft .NET 4.0 Framework (must be <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851">installed separately</a> if not already present on your computer).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="f-4b14-5bbc-098d-5606f97b26ab_Troubleshooting_Installation">Troubleshooting Installation</h2>
        <p>There may be times when you run into issues installing the Sugar Plug-in for Excel. We will provide some helpful solutions to common problems you may encounter.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>During the installation process, you are prompted with a message that says "Microsoft Excel 2010 32bit(x86) was not detected on this machine. Please confirm you are using the proper setup of plugin". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d21eb585-48f9-a492-6c5f-55028b68649a.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d21eb585-48f9-a492-6c5f-55028b68649a.png" width="408" /><br /> You may be using the incorrect Sugar Plug-in download file, so you will need to download the Sugar Plug-in for Excel 2010 x64 and re-install. Please review the <a href="#5618705f-4b14-5bbc-098d-5606f97b26ab">Install Sugar Plug-in for Excel</a> section in this article for installation steps.</li>
            <li>After entering in your login credentials and Sugar instance URL in the settings window, you see a message that says "Unable to Connect to the URL provided". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/61705677-608a-31bc-14ec-55028b74d50e.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/61705677-608a-31bc-14ec-55028b74d50e.png" width="252" /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Click "OK" to close out the error message and confirm that you entered in the correct SugarCRM URL. Check to make sure that the instance URL begins with 'https://'. Also check to see if your instance URL redirects you to another destination address. If this is the case, please enter in the new destination address into the SugarCRM Excel Add-In Settings window and try to connect again.</p>
