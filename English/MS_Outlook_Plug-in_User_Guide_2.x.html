For more information regarding the Sync to mail client option, please refer to the Contacts documentation in the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/">Application Guide</a> for your edition and version of Sugar. In order to initiate the synchronization, you will need to either click the Sync to Sugar option in the Contacts view or click the <a href="#c4bd4-5728-de85-7e6f-5606f9ecd4be_Syncing_to_Sugar">Sync to Sugar</a> option and select "Contacts" in the Mail view. Please note that the Outlook plug-in syncs any new and updated records since the last sync between Sugar and Outlook. A dialog box will appear during the synchronization process indicating that records are being synced between Outlook and Sugar, and the box will close once the sync completes.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/94fbb52c-de81-8771-0f49-552c392567fb.png" alt="SynchronizingContacts SyncToSugar Contacts" width="274" /></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you no longer wish to sync the contact record to Outlook, simply uncheck the "Sync to mail client" option and the synchronization will be suspended going forward.</p><h3 id="c4bd4-5728-de85-7e6f-5606f9ecd4be_Handling_Conflicts">Handling Conflicts</h3><p>While synchronizing contacts, there may be situations where a conflict in data is detected between Outlook and Sugar. To help govern conflict handling behavior, you can set which system (Sugar, Outlook) prevails when a conflict arises during synchronization. Simply navigate to the <a href="#c4bd4-5728-de85-7e6f-5606f9ecd4be_Sugar_Options_Window">Sugar Options Window</a>, click the Contacts tab, and select one of the three options under the Conflict Handling section: "Allow user to specify", "Sugar version prevails", and "Outlook version prevails". The Outlook plug-in will sync the data accordingly based on the system that prevails. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a1e31f6e-43c6-3e35-4964-552c3bb47682.png" alt="SynchronizingContacts ConflictHandling" width="412" /></p><h3 id="c4bd4-5728-de85-7e6f-5606f9ecd4be_Syncing_Contacts_to_Sugar_Accounts">Syncing Contacts to Sugar Accounts</h3><p>When synchronizing an Outlook contact to Sugar, the Outlook plug-in will also perform a lookup of matching Sugar accounts based on the value in the contact's Company field. If there is a matching record found, the Sugar account will be related to the synced contact record. If the company name does not exist in Sugar, then a new account will be created and related to the synced contact record. When viewing the contact form in Outlook, the Set Company to Sugar Account option is also available for you to search and select an existing Sugar account (e.g. ABC Company). Once you select the appropriate Sugar account from the Select Account window, the account's name (e.g. ABC Company) will populate in the Company field of the contact form. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d24c0dbf-fc47-ec0c-53d7-552c4abe0314.png" alt="SynchronizingContacts SetCompanyToSugarAcct" width="582" /></p><p>You can also search and select Sugar accounts to relate to new contacts you are creating via the New Sugar Record option in the ribbon on the Mail view.

For example, if a new contact is created in Outlook named "John Smith" with email address "john@example.com" and you sync this contact to Sugar, the plug-in will first check to see if the record already exists in Sugar based on the name and email address. If a matching contact record is found, the appropriate data will be synced and the "Sync to mail client" option will be automatically marked in Sugar. However, if no match is found in Sugar, then a new contact record (John Smith) will be created and the "Sync to mail client" option will be marked as well. </p><p>Please note that the same process is applied when synchronizing Sugar contacts to Outlook. The Outlook plug-in will check to see if a contact already exists in Outlook with the same name and email address. If the contact exists in Outlook, then the appropriate data will be synced to the matching contact. However, if no match is found in Outlook, then a new contact record will be created in Outlook. Please note that the Outlook contact will automatically be marked for sync as well.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: There is a <a href="#c4bd4-5728-de85-7e6f-5606f9ecd4be_Synchronization_Settings">setting</a> (Filter duplicate contacts) under the Contacts tab of the Sugar Options window that allows you to enable or disable the duplicate check for contacts.</p><h3 id="c4bd4-5728-de85-7e6f-5606f9ecd4be_Deleting_Contacts">Deleting Contacts</h3><p>When an Outlook contact that is synchronized to Sugar gets deleted, the associated contact record in Sugar will not get deleted, but the "Sync to mail client" option will become disabled on the next subsequent sync. Going forward, any changes made to the contact record in Sugar will no longer be synchronized to Outlook until the sync option is re-enabled again. In addition, when a contact record gets deleted in Sugar, the Mark to Sync option for the corresponding Outlook contact will become disabled on the next subsequent sync as well.

Please note that this option can only be used if the Outlook contact is not already marked for sync to Sugar. A duplicate check will be performed when pushing the lead to Sugar, and if a duplicate lead is found with a matching name and email address, the lead record will not be created in Sugar. Please note that the Send To Leads option is a one time push to Sugar and there will not be any subsequent syncs to the Lead record after the initial sync. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4f0a5f4a-7b7a-e400-5064-552c33a9183d.png" alt="SynchronizingContacts Contacts SendToLeads" width="339" /></p><p>You can also create new leads in Sugar by clicking the New Sugar Record option in the ribbon on the Mail view, then selecting "Leads".
